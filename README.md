## AroundWeb: A Cloud and React based Social Network
### Demo: 
![https://github.com/kelongchen/AroundWeb/blob/master/around_demo.gif]
### Frontend:
- Designed and implemented a geo-based social network web application with React JS. 
- Implemented features for users to create and browse posts and support search nearby posts (Ant Design, GeoLocation API and Google Map API.)
- Improved the authentication using token based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4 and server-side user authentication with JWT. 
####  `Relevant technical skills and APIs:`
  - React JS
  - Ant Design
  - react router
  - react-grid-gallery
  - Google Map API
  
### Backend:
- Launched a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (Google Kubernetes Engine) 
- Used ElasticSearch (deployed to GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)
- Used Google Vision API to provide a face detection model and integrate with the Go service.
####  `Relevant technical skills and APIs:`
  - Go
  - Elasticsearch
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Google Compute Engine
  - Google Vision API
  - Google Kubernetes Engine
  - Docker container
  - CircleCI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
