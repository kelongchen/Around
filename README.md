## Around: ReactJS/Golang/GCS based Social Network

- Developed the frontend with ReactJS/Redux and used webpack as module bundler
- Implemented features for users to create and browse posts and support searching nearby posts (Ant Design, GeoLocation API and Google Map API); used Google Cloud Storage to store media data
- Implemented token-based authentication with JWT; integrated React Router v4 for routing
- Launched a scalable web server in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine.
- Used Elasticsearch to provide geo-location based search, deployed to Google Cloud Engine/Ubuntu
- Used Google Vision API for face detection, integrated with Elasticsearch and Go service
- Built and published a Docker image to DockerHub for backend service, and deployed it to GKE
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline by using CircleCI and deployed application to Google App Engine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
